<h1>Motivation</h1>
<div id="subtitle">Security is a critical aspect of software systems, but vulnerabilities can compromise their integrity. 
While automated analysis approaches based on static and dynamic program analysis for detecting vulnerabilities have proven effective, they often require extensive human involvement for tasks like defining sources and sinks or drafting graph queries.
Conversely, LLMs have demonstrated impressive capabilities in code generation and analysis but suffer from challenges like hallucinations and limited input/output token lengths. 
Bridging these gaps by synergistically integrating the strengths of LLMs and traditional program analysis offers a promising path toward significant advancements in automated vulnerability detection and exploitation.</div>
</div>
<p>The key insight of the project is that the interplays between LLMs and traditional program analysis complement the downside of each approach so that the combination will outperform a simple addition of these two.
On one hand, LLMs, while prone to hallucinations and token limitations, can benefit from classic program analysis to extract essential information, such as program slices, for detecting and exploiting vulnerabilities;
at the same time, program analysis can verify and validate the LLMs’ outputs, e.g., whether a given vulnerability found by LLMs exists and is correct. On the other hand, traditional program analysis, which often requires substantial human effort to configure sources, sinks, and graph queries, can be automated and streamlined with the help of LLMs, reducing manual involvement and increasing efficiency.</p>
